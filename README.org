*Headless Hunter* is a terminal-first, autonomous agent that cuts through the noise of modern job boards. It doesn't just search; it *scouts, scrapes, and analyzes* with a cynical eye to find only the roles that actually fit your profile.

** Why?

1.  *Aggregator Hell*: Skip the "Ghost Jobs" and sponsored clutter of job boards.
2.  *Deep Intelligence*: Scrapes past the "Show More" buttons to analyze the full job description.
3.  *Privacy First*: Run the entire reasoning engine locally with Ollama. No data leaks.
4.  *Cynical Analysis*: The agent is trained to be skeptical, filtering out roles that don't match your technical depth.

** Quick Start

1. *Env*: ~nix develop~
2. *Config*: Copy ~.env-example~ to ~.env~ and add API keys.
3. *Input*: Drop your ~resume.md~ in the root.
4. *Run*: ~bun run src/index.tsx~

** Workflow & Architecture

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
[Resume + User Prompt] -> (Profiler) -> (Scout) -> (Analyst) -> (Reporter) -> [Report]
#+END_EXAMPLE

- *Profiler*: Extracts search criteria (JSON) from resume.
- *Scout*: Finds targets via Tavily (Prod) or DuckDuckGo (Test).
- *Analyst*: Deeply scrapes job pages (Puppeteer).
- *Reporter*: Synthesizes final cynical report.
- *Recovery*: Repairs malformed LLM outputs, if needed.

** Configuration (.env)

| Var | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| ~LLM_PROVIDER~ | Default provider (~local~ or ~google~). |
| ~LLM_PROVIDER_{ROLE}~ | Override specific node (e.g. ~LLM_PROVIDER_SCOUT~). |
| ~GOOGLE_API_KEY~ | Required for Google provider. |
| ~TAVILY_API_KEY~ | Required for Production Search. |

** Dev & Test

- *Lint/Format*: ~bun run lint~ / ~bun run format~
- *Test*: ~bun test~ (Switches to Free Mode: DDG + Local Scraper).
